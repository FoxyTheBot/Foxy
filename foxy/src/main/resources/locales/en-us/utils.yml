      Hey <@!{0}>! Since you didn't claim your daily prize, I had to collect **{1} Cakes** to keep them from getting lost.

      I'll continue collecting this fee every week until you claim your daily prize again.

      Don't forget to collect your daily prize [by clicking here]({2}) to protect your Cakes!

        Hey <@!{0}>! I noticed you have more than **{1} Cakes** and haven't claimed your daily for more than **{2} days**!

        I'm keeping an eye on your **{3} Cakes**, and if you don't claim your daily, I'll need to claim **{4} Cakes** from you (15% fee) to help keep everything in order.

        But don't worry! Just claim your daily [by clicking here]({5}) and you won't lose anything.

        If you continue to not claim it, this fee will be charged every week until you claim your daily again.

        Protect your Cakes, or I'll eat them all :3
